Run SketchUp Make in container
==============================

Running SketchUp on Linux requires installation of Wine. That can
certainly be done as it is packaged for example for Fedora but
I prefer to keep my core workstation installation free of software
that I only use from time to time or which I only use for specific
purpose.

This repository helps me to run SketchUp Make 2017 from container
image, installed separately from by workstation packages.

Build image
-----------

This repository does not distribute the actual SketchUp Make binary.
Download the Windows version from

	https://www.sketchup.com/download/make

and place it to this directory.

Then run

	sudo docker build --build-arg=uid=12345 -t sketchup .

replacing the 12345 with your uid, under which you will want to start
the container. You can find it out by running

	id -u
