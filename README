Run SketchUp Make in container
==============================

Running SketchUp on Linux requires installation of Wine. That can
certainly be done as it is packaged for example for Fedora but
I prefer to keep my core workstation installation free of software
that I only use from time to time or which I only use for specific
purpose.

This repository helps me to run SketchUp Make 2017 from container
image, installed separately from by workstation packages.

Build image
-----------

This repository does not distribute the actual SketchUp Make binary.
Download the Windows version from

	https://www.sketchup.com/download/make

and place it to this directory.

Then run

	sudo docker build --build-arg=uid=$(id -u) -t sketchup .

Run the container
-----------------

The container image expects the directory with .skp files bind-mounted
to /data directory in the container. This is an example command to
run the container, mounting the current directory:

	sudo docker run --read-only \
		--tmpfs /tmp -v /tmp/.wine-$(id -u) \
		-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
		--security-opt=label:type:spc_t --user=$(id -u):$(id -g) \
		-v /tmp/.X11-unix/X0:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0 \
		--device=/dev/dri/card0:/dev/dri/card0 \
		-v $(pwd):/data --rm sketchup

SketchUp and Wine will store some config and state information in
subdirectory .sketchup-run/ of the directory mounted to /data,
creating that subdirectory upon the first run if needed. It should be
safe to remove that subdirectory.
